# C++ Project Template (VS Code + CMake)

This is a simple and extensible C++ project template for Windows using VS Code and CMake. It supports automatic fetching and building of dependencies and provides full IntelliSense support in VS Code.

The example in the template includes raylib and is fully executable within VS Code, e.g. `RUN AND DEBUG -> Launch MyProject`, or by hitting F5.
